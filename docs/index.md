FFA-Net Documentation
Welcome to the Feature Fusion Attention Network (FFA-Net) documentation. This documentation provides a detailed overview of the FFA-Net architecture, implementation, and its various components. FFA-Net is designed for single image dehazing tasks, utilizing advanced attention mechanisms to selectively enhance important features, resulting in clearer images even in challenging hazy conditions.

Overview
FFA-Net introduces an efficient and scalable approach for image dehazing by incorporating multiple attention mechanisms that help focus on both channel and spatial information. This network is based on a progressive refinement of features at multiple stages, ensuring high-quality dehazing results.

Key Features
Attention Mechanisms: FFA-Net employs multiple attention layers such as Channel Attention (CA), Pixel Attention (PA), Efficient Attention, and Progressive Attention Refinement, making it highly effective in extracting and refining features.
Residual Learning: Each block in the network integrates residual connections to retain crucial features from previous layers while progressively refining them.
Modular Design: The network is structured in modular groups, making it flexible and extendable for other tasks in image processing.
